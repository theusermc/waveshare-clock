# waveshare-clock
just a simple digital clock that shows the current system time and date on a waveshare 2.13 (v3) display.

requirements:

 - raspberry pi 
 - waveshare 2.13 (preferably v3)
 - python3
 - some python knowledge

to clone and run, 

    git clone https://github.com/theusermc/waveshare-clock.git
    python3 clock.py
i've also included the `epd2in13_V3` and `epdconfig` libraries and a couple of fonts to make everything a little simple.

you also might want to install Pillow if you haven't already:
`pip install Pillow`

please make a project issue if theres anything that goes wrong.
